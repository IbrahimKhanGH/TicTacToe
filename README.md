# TicTacToe
Work In Progress
Last updated 09/30/22

Tic-Tac-Toe was a project that I started during the beginning of my introduction to object-oriented programming with java class, and it is one of my more organized pieces of code. This is because, with this code, I utilized object-oriented programming, something that I have never done outside of class on a project before. The code has many different classes, which all represent an object within the game The board, the squares on the board, the player, each symbol, etc.). It is a project that I am currently working on, and proud to say almost finish with.
